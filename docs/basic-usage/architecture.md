# Architecture

The Filament Attachment Library package is built on top of the robust [Laravel Attachment Library](https://github.com/VanOns/laravel-attachment-library). Understanding
the architecture and the relationship between these two packages is crucial for effective implementation.

## Key responsibilities

- **User Interface**: Offer a sleek and easy-to-navigate interface for managing files.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Filament resources to enhance user interactions.
- **User Experience**: Prioritize ease of use, ensuring that end-users can manage files effortlessly.

## Dependency

This package cannot function as a standalone package; instead, it extends and enhances the capabilities provided by the
Laravel library. This separation of concerns ensures that each package can fulfill its specific purpose effectively:

- **Laravel Attachment Library**: Focuses on the core file processing logic and maintains close integration with Laravel.
- **Filament Attachment Library**: Focuses on the presentation and user interaction layer, making file management accessible
- and straightforward for end-users.

By maintaining this architectural distinction, each package can evolve independently while working together to provide a
comprehensive file management solution. This approach ensures that both developers and end-users have the tools they need
to manage files efficiently and effectively.

Explore the documentation to see how you can leverage both packages to include file management functionalities in your
Filament applications. Make sure to also view the [documentation](https://github.com/VanOns/laravel-attachment-library/blob/master/docs/README.md)
of the Laravel package for additional configuration options.
